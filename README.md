# Play.js TS setup
Just a setup in order to use TS, .tsx files and Styled Components in Play.Js
#### Select the React Template, tap "Clone from git repository" option and clone it; after creation press the play button on "node index.js", select "tsc" and press play again. Press the "world" icon. Done it.
##### Note: @types/styled-components has an issue [#33311](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/33311). As a workaround it was added compilerOptions.types. For a small project like this I think is enough. But remember you can still use CSS if you dont want to use SC.
